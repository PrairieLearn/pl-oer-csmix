    <p>
        The inputs to the datapath are a clock signal and a reset signal.
    </p>

    <p>
        The clock signal and reset signals are the inputs to the PC register, in addition to an enable (hardcoded to 1)
        and an input nextPC (32 bits). The output is PC (32bits).
    </p>

    <p>
        PC is input A of an ALU whose input B is the number 4, the control is ADD. Its output becomes input 0 to a mux4.
        Input 1 of that mux is the output of another ALU. That ALU's input A is the output of the previous ALU and its
        input B is the branch offset (32 bits). The control signal is add. Input 2 of this mux is the concatenation of
        the 4 MSBs of PC+4, the 26 LSBs of inst, and two zeros as the LSBs. Input 3 of the mux is the output A_data of
        the register file. The control for the mux4 is the signal control_type and its output is nextPC.
    </p>

    <p>
        The 30 MSBs of PC are also the input addr to instruction memory, which outputs inst (32 bits).
    </p>

    <p>
        The six MSBs and the 6 LSBs of inst are the opcode and funct inputs to the MIPS instruction decoder,
        respectively. The decoder also takes the zero flag from another ALU. The outputs of the decoder are: alu_op (3
        bits), write_enable, rd_src, alu_src2 (2 bits), control_type (2 bits), lui, slt, byte_load, word_we,
        byte_we, mem_read, and except.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, the 16 LSBs of the inst are also inputs to the sign extender, which outputs a 32 bit number. Its
        output is the input to a left shift by 2 module, which outputs the 32-bit branch offset.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, the inst is also an input to the register file. Bits 21 through 25 (inclusive) is rs, which is the
        input A_addr. Bits 16 through 20 (inclusive) is rt, which is the input B_addr. Bits 11 through 15 (inclusive)
        are rd, and rd are rt are inputs 0 and 1 respectively to a mux that uses rd_src as the control bit. The output
        of that mux is the input W_addr of the register. The register also takes the signals wr_enable, clock, and reset
        as well as the input W_data, which is the output of the LUI mux, which selects between the output of the MEM_READ mux
        and the 16 LSBs of the inst (also known as the immediate). The outputs of the register file are A_data and
        B_data, which are 32 bits.
    </p>

    <p>
        B_data is the input 0 of a mux. Input 1 of that mux is the output of the sign extender and input 2 is the
        immediate. The control bits for that mux is the 2-bit signal alu_src2.
    </p>

    <p>
        The output of that mux is the B input of an ALU whose A input is A_data from the register. The ALU outputs the
        overflow, zero, and negative flags, and a 32 bit number.
    </p>

    <p>
        This output is the input 0 of the SLT mux. Input 1 of the SLT mux is 31'b0. Its output is the 0 input to the MEM_READ
        mux. The control bit for the SLT mux is slt.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, the 32 bit number from the ALU is the 32-bit input addr in the data memory. Data memory has a 32-bit 
        input named data_in which comes from an output of the register file, B_data. Data memory also takes in the signals
        word_we, byte_we, clock, and reset. The output of the data memory is 32-bits and called data_out. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The output data_out is split into parts which is fed into a mux4. Bits 31 to 24 (inclusive) is the input 3, bits 23 to 
        16 (inclusive) is the input 2, bits 15 to 8 (inclusive) is the input 1, and bits 7 to 0 (inclusive) is the input 0. The output 
        of the mux4 is the input 1 for the BYTE_LOAD mux. The control bit for the mux4 is the least significant bit of the 32-bit 
        number from the output of ALU.  
    </p>

    <p>
        The BYTE_LOAD mux takes in the output of the mux4 from above as the input 1. The input 0 for the BYTE_LOAD mux is the 32-bit 
        data_out from data_memory. Its output is the input 1 to the MEM_READ mux. The control bit for the BYTE_LOAD mux is byte_load. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The MEM_READ mux takes in the output of the BYTE_LOAD mux from above as the input 1. The input 0 for the MEM_READ mux is the 
        output from the SLT mux. Its ouput is the input 0 to the LUI mux. The control bit for the MEM_READ mux is mem_read.
