    <p>
        The inputs to the datapath are a clock signal and a reset signal.
    </p>

    <p>
        The clock signal and reset signals are the inputs to the PC register, in addition to an enable (hardcoded to 1)
        and an input nextPC (32 bits). The output is PC (32bits).
    </p>

    <p>
        PC is input A of an ALU whose input B is the number 4, the control is ADD. Its output becomes input 0 to a mux4.
        Input 1 of that mux is the output of another ALU. That ALU's input A is the output of the previous ALU and its
        input B is the branch offset (32 bits). The control signal is add. Input 2 of this mux is the concatenation of
        the 4 MSBs of PC+4, the 26 LSBs of inst, and two zeros as the LSBs. Input 3 of the mux is the output from the JRO mux.
        The control for the mux4 is the signal control_type and its output is nextPC.
    </p>

    <p>
        The 30 MSBs of PC are also the input addr to instruction memory, which outputs inst (32 bits).
    </p>

    <p>
        The six MSBs and the 6 LSBs of inst are the opcode and funct inputs to the MIPS instruction decoder,
        respectively. The decoder also takes the zero flag from another ALU. The outputs of the decoder are: alu_op (3
        bits), write_enable, rd_src, alu_src2 (2 bits), control_type (2 bits), lui, slt, jro, and except.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, the 16 LSBs of the inst are also inputs to the sign extender, which outputs a 32 bit number. Its
        output is the input to a left shift by 2 module, which outputs the 32-bit branch offset.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, the inst is also an input to the register file. Bits 21 through 25 (inclusive) is rs, which is the
        input A_addr. Bits 16 through 20 (inclusive) is rt, which is the input B_addr. Bits 11 through 15 (inclusive)
        are rd, and rd are rt are inputs 0 and 1 respectively to a mux that uses rd_src as the control bit. The output
        of that mux is the input W_addr of the register. The register also takes the signals wr_enable, clock, and reset
        as well as the input W_data, which is the output of the LUI mux, which selects between the output of the SLT mux
        and the 16 LSBs of the inst (also known as the immediate). The outputs of the register file are A_data and
        B_data, which are 32 bits.
    </p>

    <p>
        B_data is the input 0 of a mux. Input 1 of that mux is the output of the sign extender and input 2 is the
        immediate. The control bits for that mux is the 2-bit signal alu_src2.
    </p>

    <p>
        The output of that mux is the B input of an ALU whose A input is A_data from the register. The ALU outputs the
        overflow, zero, and negative flags, and a 32 bit number.
    </p>

    <p>
        This output is the input 0 of the SLT mux. Input 1 of the SLT mux is 31'b0. Its output is the 0 input to the LUI
        mux. The control bit for the SLT mux is slt.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, this output is also input 1 of the JRO mux. Input 0 of the JRO mux is A_data from the register. Its 
        output is the 3 input to the mux4 that inputs into the PC regsiter. The control bit for the JRO mux is jro.
