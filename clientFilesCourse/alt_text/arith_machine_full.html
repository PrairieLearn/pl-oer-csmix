        The inputs to the arithmetic machine are a clock signal and a reset signal.
    </p>

    <p>
        The clock and reset signals the inputs to the PC register, in addition to and enable (hardcoded to 1) and an
        input nextPC (32 bits). The output is PC (32bits).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        PC is input A of an ALU whose input B is the number 4, the control is ADD, and the output is nextPC (32 bits).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The 30 MSBs of PC are also the input addr to instruction memory, which outputs inst (32 bits).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The six MSBs and the 6 LSBs of inst are the opcode and funct inputs to the MIPS instruction decoder,
        respectively. The outputs of the decoder are: alu_op (3 bits), write_enable, rd_src, and alu_src2 (2 bits).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Additionally, the 16 LSBs of the inst are also inputs to both the sign extender and the zero extender, both of
        which output 32 bit numbers.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        The inst is also an input to the register file. Bits 21 through 25 (inclusive) is rs, which is the input A_addr.
        Bits 16 through 20 (inclusive) is rt, which is the input B_addr. Bits 11 through 15 (inclusive) are rd, and rd
        are rt are inputs 0 and 1 respectively to a mux that uses rd_src as the control bit. The output of that mux is
        the input W_addr of the register. The register also takes the signals wr_enable, clock, and reset. It also has
        the input W_data, which is the output of another ALU. The outputs of the register file are A_data and B_data,
        which are 32 bits.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        B_data is the input 0 of a mux. Input 1 of that mux is the output of the sign extender and input 2 is the output
        fo the zero extender. The control bits for that mux is the 2-bit signal alu_src2. The output of that mux is the
        B input of the ALU for which A_data is its A input. It outputs the overflow, zero, and negative flags, and a 32
        bit number (which is the input W_data of the register).
