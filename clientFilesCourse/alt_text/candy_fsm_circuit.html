        The sequential circuit is split into 5 DFFEs.
        The first DFFE takes in nextA which is defined as (n and A) xor (d and D). It also takes in the signal clk.
        The second DFFE takes in nextB and outputs B. It also takes in the signal clk.
        The third DFFE takes in nextC and outputs C. It also takes in the signal clk.
        The fourth DFFE takes in nextD and outputs D. It also takes in the signal clk.
        The fifth DFFE takes in nextE which is defined as C and n' and d.
        The final output of the sequential circuit is candy which is defined by D xor E.

        The FSM has states 5 states: A/c', B/c', C/c', D/c, and E/c. Each state has 3 transitions.
        State A/c' has: d'n' which is a self loop, d'n which points to B/c', and dn' which points to C/c'.
        State B/c' has: d'n' which is a self loop, d'n which points to C/c', and dn' which points to D/c',
        State C/c' has: d'n' which is a self loop, d'n which points to D/c, and dn' which points to E/c.
        State D/c has: d'n' which points to A/c', d'n which points to B/c', and dn' which points to C/c'.
        E/c has d'n' which points to B/c', d'n which points to C/c', and dn' which points to D/c.
