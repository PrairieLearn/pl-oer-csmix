This question is based on Chapter 4 in Kurose & Ross "Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach" (8th edition). After submission, the "Correct Answer" panel shows a detailed explanation. Also, if the submission is not completely correct, the "Submitted Answer" panel includes some feedback about the specific errors in the submission.

Note: this question parses submissions and "invalidates" submissions that are not a valid address in dotted decimal notation, or subnet masks that are not valid subnet masks, so they do not "count" as a submission.
