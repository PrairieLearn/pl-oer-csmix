<p>
  Suppose you are given the following array, and you wish to transform it into a MinHeap.
  <br>
  <pl-python-variable params-name="input" prefix="${\tt x} =$"></pl-python-variable>
</p>

<p>
  Write out the array ${\tt heap}$ that would result from running BuildHeap on the input array.
  Use the most efficient implementation of BuildHeap. Please assume that the first entry box is cell 1 (and do not leave an empty
  entry in the table).

  <pl-matrix-component-input answers-name="arr" label="${\tt heap} =$" allow-partial-credit="true" weight="4"></pl-matrix-component-input>
</p>
