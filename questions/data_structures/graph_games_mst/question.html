<p>
  In each of the given graphs, we have marked a minimum spanning tree (MST), but we have not told you the weights of the edges!
  Label each MST edge with the <b>largest</b> possible integer it can be, subject to the constraints in the problem part. (Where there are multiple correct answers that satisfy the constraints, any such answer will receive credit.)
  <!-- Note that in each case, the given MST is unique--there is no other spanning tree with the same total cost. -->

      All the edge weights of edges actually in the MST must be unique. (However, their weights may duplicate weights of non-MST edges.) There is no other MST with this same weight.
