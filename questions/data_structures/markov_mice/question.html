<p>Suppose a mouse is sitting somewhere in the floor plan below. When a bell rings, the mouse runs to a new room through one of the
doors. The mouse is equally likely to choose any one of the doors in its current room. </p>

<p>
The mouse's location over time can be modeled using a Markov Chain. Fill in the table below so that cell $(i,j)$ contains 
the probability the mouse moves from room $i$ to room $j$ in one ring of the bell. In our notation, $i$ denotes a row, and $j$
denotes a column. The rooms are arranged alphabetically over the rows and columns.

Suppose the mouse begins in room {{params.startroom}}. What is the probability the mouse will visit room {{params.tworoom}} within
the first two bell rings?
